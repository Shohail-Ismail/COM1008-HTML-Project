# Background Information

This website was made for my University's COM1008 (Web Systems and Architecture) assignment and utilises HTML/CSS to create a mobile-responsive site showing skills in web development, site accessibility configuration, and cross-browser compatibility. 

# Core Features

Accessibility guidelines and HTML validation were applied to meet WCAG standards, enhancing user experience for all visitors. The mobile-responsive design was done to provide optimal viewing across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. Performance optimisation - such as image compression - improved loading times, while cross-browser testing ensured consistent functionality and appearance. Interactive elements, such as quizzes with visual feedback and smooth CSS transitions, were also incorporated to enhance the UX and engagement. 

# Testing and Limitations

Testing has been done on the website and some limitations identified, with these viewable through the 'Testing' section in the website.

Some hyperlinks may not work due to expired ShortURL links.

# Running the program

To view, navigate to the website folder and view `index.html` through a web browser, after which you can navigate to other pages through hyperlinks.
