        <h2>About the Staff-Student Committee</h2>
        <p class="info">
            The staff-student committee plays a crucial role
            in fostering collaboration between teachers and
            students, and serves as an extension of the
            learning community as a whole. We aim to not only
            provide a platform of correspondence between staff
            and students, but unite the two groups to allow
            for a synergistic, hospitable educational environment! </p>

        <ul id="sslc-uses">
            <li>Addressing concerns regarding academia</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The primary mission of the Staff-Student Liaison Committee
            (SSLC) is to serve as a dedicated forum for students to
            address concerns related to academia, whether it be about
            coursework, teaching methods, or any other academic
            matter. By allowing students to raise their concerns
            with a committee member or with a teacher via a committee
            member in their field of study, any issues can be understood
            better and resolved/relayed with ease. </p>

        </ul>
        <p> The SSLC encourages and provides a medium for open and
            transparent communication between teachers and students,
            allowing for ideas, feedback, and suggestions to be exchanged
            and taken seriously. We do this by using representatives,
            through who you can speak to your teachers, thus creating a
            space where everyone's perspectives are valued and considered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help and advice with University life</li>
        </ul>
        <p> While our student representatives' main role is to provide a
            mode of communication between teachers and students, they are
            also individuals with unique experiences and knowledge to whom
            you can directly voice any concerns or ask questions.
