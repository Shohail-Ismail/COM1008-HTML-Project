        <h3>Design statement</h3>
        <p> The University of Sheffield SSLC website was made by Shohail Ismail
            as a HTML/CSS project as part of the Computer Science (Course code: G403)
            COM1008 coursework. It is intended to be an informative yet informal website
            that serves to entertain as well as educate. It was designed using
            Mobile-First Responsive Web Design principles, thus catering to
            all devices and - owing to its a wide range of accessibility features -
            to all people as well.

        <h3>Reasoning</h3>
        <p> <strong>For screen size</strong>, I will aim to use roughly 3 breakpoints based on screen width; small
            (500px and below), medium (501px - 750px) and large (751px and above).
            The tweakpoints I aim to include will likely be in relation to the
            header, footer and some elements of the margins for the body as these
            are the areas that are most at risk of deformation with the changing of
            screen sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For resolution</strong>, I aim to include low-resolution and high-resolution versions
            of every image for their corresponding devices, therefore there will be
            2 breakpoints. The tweakpoints I will likely include are the images that I use, as
            there will be 2 possible images for each &lt;img&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>For orientation</strong>, I aim to create 2 breakpoints for 'landscape' and
            'portrait' orientations, with the tweakpoints focussing on te footer, header and
            aspects of the body's margin and padding, as switching from the standard portrait
            to landscape orientation can be accounted for on a computer due to the lower
            aspect ratio compared to a mobile's landscape version, which has a significantly
            higher aspect ratio and so more width that must be filled. It would also be
            beneficial to implement a larger scrollbar for horizontal mobile devices as the standard
            scrollbar may be too small and not ergonomic to use.
        </p>
        <h3>Menu System</h3>
        <p> <strong>Flexbox:</strong>
            I have chosen to use flexboxes as opposed to grid layout as flexboxes
            are versatile and simple to implement for a responsive menu system. Their ability to handle
            the dynamic arrangement and alignment of items within a container make them an ideal choice for
            constructing flexible and adaptive layouts, thereby also ensuring a user-friendly
            experience.</p>
        <p><strong>Media Queries:</strong>
            Media queries are employed to adjust the menu system's appearance and behavior across
            different screen sizes, orientations and resolutions. By using breakpoints encompassing
            certain tweakpoints, media queries allow for targeted adjustments in styling based on certain
            device conditions, thus enhancing the usability of the menu and promoting
            readability and accessibility.
