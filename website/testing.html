        <h3> Optimisation </h3>
        <p> To enhance the website experience, images have been compressed
            losslessly to reduce file size without compromising on quality.
            This ensures faster loading times on all devices, thus contributing to
            a pleasant browsing experience.
        </p>
        <h3> Debugging </h3>
        <p> Using Steve Faulkner's 'NU HTML Checker', I checked each of my
            pages for errors, inconsistencies, and poor code, through which
            I validated, debugged, and optimised it.
        </p>

            <h4>index.html</h4>
            <p>
                After passing the 'Home' page into the validation checker, the following
                message was shown:
            </p>
            <img src="images/1.png" alt="index.html validation">
            <p>To rectify this, a language attribute was defined for the &lt;html&gt;
            tags as "English" and the character set was defined as 'UTF-8', as this
            is enough to encode most characters that the average user will
            use and so is convention.

            <p> After making the necessary changes, passing 'index.html' back into the
                website reveals that it has now been validated according to
                the WCAG guidelines that the website checks against.

            <h4>purpose.html</h4>
            <p>
                Inputting 'purpose.html' shows that there is, first and foremost,
                a simple syntax error where &lt;head&gt; has been duplicated. This
                can be fixed immediately before referring to the other errors.

                After this is another simple issue that arose due to &lt;body&gt; being above
                &lt;footer&gt;, which can also be fixed by simply nesting &lt;footer&gt;
                inside &lt;body&gt;.

                Passing the newly-edited 'purpose.html' into the checker reveals
                that the errors have been sorted and the page is validated.

            <h4>membership.html</h4>
            <p> Passing in 'membership.html' shows that it is already free of errors,
                meaning it is validated. </p>

            <h4>correspondence.html</h4>
            <p> As with 'membership.html', the 'Meetings and Correspondence' page
                shows that it possesses no errors and so can be considered to be validated.

            <img src="images/14.png" alt="correspondence.html validation">

            <h4>contact.html</h4>
            <p> 'contacts.html' is shown to have a syntax error stemming from using the
                'placeholder' attribute with the &lt;select&gt; element, which is not valid
                as &lt;select&gt; offers a drop-down menu that cannot have a placeholder statement
                without the statement being one of the choosable options. Therefore, it is removed.

            <img src="images/17.png" alt="contacts.html validation">
            <p> Following through from the previous error, the first option of a required
                single-selection, drop-down &lt;select&gt; menu must be a placeholder option which
                is intended to be used to inform the user of how to use the menu. Although the
                error statement offers a 'size' attribute equal to the number of option elements
                be used, this is not the intended layout of the menu and would make it large
                and clunky, which is antithetical to the simplistic, modern design that is required. Therefore,
                a placeholder option label is added with no value for the 'value' attribute to ensure it will never
                be recorded by the server as a valid option.

            <h4>legal.html</h4>
            <p> The error in 'legal.html' is that &lt;section&gt;s have been used without any headings,
                meaning they serve no other purpose than encapsulating similar chunks of text, which can
                be accomplished with &lt;div&gt;s and so are replaced.

        <h3> Browser testing </h3>
        <p> I tested 3 different browsers (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox emulator, and Microsoft
            Edge emulator) and found that all 3 can run the website as intended and all links direct to the page that they
            are required to. This is due to all 3 browsers adhering to standards set by
            the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for HTML5 and therefore render the pages
            identically.
            <br> Furthermore, by using the Google Chrome Remote Desktop tool, I was able to view
            the website on my phone, thereby getting a mobile view of the website.
